# Cursor Examples
Examples from my coding either as a template OR a finished project ready for you to customize.
Each folder will be in the following type:
```
[folder]
  |
  |-- .language
  |
  |-- [folder files]
```
Where `.language` will contain
```javascript
LANG -> "[node.js, python, html, ...]"
DESC -> "[description of project]"
INDEX -> "[The 'index' file to be run. Usually index.js, index.py, index.html, ...]"
TYPE* -> "[A template or customizable project? Seldom put]"
```
